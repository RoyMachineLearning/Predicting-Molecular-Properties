Kaggle Competition : Predicting Molecular Properties

In this competition, you will develop an algorithm that can predict the magnetic interaction between two atoms in a molecule (i.e., the scalar coupling constant).

About Scalar Coupling

Using NMR to gain insight into a molecule’s structure and dynamics depends on the ability to accurately predict so-called “scalar couplings”. These are effectively the magnetic interactions between a pair of atoms. The strength of this magnetic interaction depends on intervening electrons and chemical bonds that make up a molecule’s three-dimensional structure.

Using state-of-the-art methods from quantum mechanics, it is possible to accurately calculate scalar coupling constants given only a 3D molecular structure as input. However, these quantum mechanics calculations are extremely expensive (days or weeks per molecule), and therefore have limited applicability in day-to-day workflows.

A fast and reliable method to predict these interactions will allow medicinal chemists to gain structural insights faster and cheaper, enabling scientists to understand how the 3D chemical structure of a molecule affects its properties and behavior.

Ultimately, such tools will enable researchers to make progress in a range of important problems, like designing molecules to carry out specific cellular tasks, or designing better drug molecules to fight disease.
